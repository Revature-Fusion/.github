# Fusion Application

## Project Description

The Fusion Application is an e-commerce shopping application that is used by Guests, Users, and Admins. Just like within a store, Fusion holds multiple different products that one can view, add to their cart, and purchase. Outside of shopping functionality, there is the security of a login that Users and Admins will have to differentiate the actions that are available to them, as well as to separate from a Guest. Logged-in Users will be able to complete the shopping functionalities as well as view their past orders that have already been completed under that account. Guests do not have to login to purchase anything, but do have an option to register for an account if they wish to view their completed purchases at a later time. Overall, this project was completed within a sprint of about two weeks with a team of 22 people developing and testing. Throughout the creation of Fusion, the primary focus was on Testing Automation along with the creation of a working e-commerce application.
